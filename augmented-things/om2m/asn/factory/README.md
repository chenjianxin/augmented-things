# Factory

## Setting
This module starts a simulation allowing the user to execute more nodes on the same host. Before starting, one has to fill the configuration file [```./om2m/asn/factory/src/main/resources/configuration/factory.xml```](http://thingstalk.altervista.org/augmented-things/configuration/factory.xml) with all relevant properties. Check the documentation for more details.

**Note**: the above file is not included in this repository and must be added manually into the right folder.
